# Lipper

Look I didn't have any good ideas and I thought about this library as being a microscope to inspect the chip but the inventor "Zacharias Janssen" didn't have a great name to steal from. And then I thought about the space themeing to ours names so I went for the inventor of the telescope "Hans Lippershey".
